2. Get to the open file dialog. This may open on its own; if not, go to `File > Open notebook...`.
3. Select the Github tab.
4. Type `cgkr/OMAE2019_ShortCourse` and click on the magnifying glass.

**To create a new file and work on it:**
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/

**Note:** If Colab notebooks are left unattended for a while, they will disconnect. This means that any code will have to be re-excecuted (no code will be lost however).
